Enclosing questions in Tuborgs {?? May I ask a first question? Think about anything. ??}

Questions can come immediately in the text. {?? Do you remember Pythagoras' equation? :\|: nobody knows exactly what is going on here $$
a^2 + b^2
$$ ??}

And then the lorem ipsum. A question can also stand out and be put in a quote.
